  <h1>Some information on Voting in USA </h1>
  <p class="styleSenator">
    Voting is an impactful action that every American citizen has the right to take. It is important to understand that voting is quintessential to spreading our voices. Voting allows us to choose who we feel best represents our ideals both at the national and state levels. Voting impacts everyone and choosing not to vote is allowing someone else to signify that their voices matter more than yours. As citizens, it is our job to expand our rights by voting for officials and reformations that we believe can improve our lives. Though voting may seem like it is unimportant, it is a fundamental right, and it echoes our voices to the law makers. Vote because your voice deserves to be heard just as much as your neighbors.

    Through it may seem like the presidency may be the only important official that is voted into office, many of the officials we see in our states and nationally also must be voted in. For example, it is just as important to vote for senators and representatives at the national and state levels, as these officials are the ones that introduce and control reformations to laws and regulations. Even in our smaller communities, voting for representatives such as school board leaders can illustrate that we care for our communities and we want the right leaders to drive us forward.

    When considering who to vote for, think about what matters to you. Consider researching topics that matter to you through bipartisan sources to figure out which candidate might have your best interests in mind. Additionally, if you are unsure about voting for the right candidate, talk to your families and friends to hear their opinions on candidates they might support. Though we find ourselves amid a political separation, make sure to consider the larger benefit one candidate might provide before making your decision.
