      <li>The senators work for the people and their key responsibilities are to fight for legislature that the people of their state would support, as they are elected by the citizens of a state.</li>

    <div id="Jhon" class = "styleSenator">

      <h2>Jhon Hickenlooper(D)</h2>

      <p>
        John Hickenlooper began his career as a geologist when he accepted a job in Colorado with Buckhorn Petroleum in 1981. However, due to a downturn in the oil industry, Hickenlooper was laid off; as a result, Hickenlooper founded the Wynkoop Brewing Company in Denver. By founding the brewing company in Denver, Hickenlooper became more involved in the community and eventually, in 2003, he ran for the mayor of Denver and won. After serving 2 terms as mayor, Hickenlooper ran for governor of Colorado and served as governor for 2 terms as well ending his time in office in 2018. Currently, Hickenlooper is running for senate of Colorado.

  <h1>Senator's positions on topics <br> </h1>

  <h2>Health Care :</h2>
  <h3>Jhon Hickenlooper : </h3>
  <p class="styleSenator">
    While Hickenlooper has always supported the Affordable Care Act, and cites plans to expand it as a part of his campaign. Hickenlooper has advocated for the expansion of government backed health plans that would allow for the US to have a universal health coverage like many other powerful countries. Hickenlooper has established that he would like to keep the field open when it comes to healthcare saying that it would be an option that the public could utilize at their discretion rather than something that everyone would be forced into. However, Hickenlooper has strongly opposed the idea of a Medicare for all system.
  </p>
  <h3>Cory Gardner :</h3>
  <p class="styleSenator">
    On the other hand, Senator Gardner has remained opposed to the Affordable Care act citing that Americans are confined to higher premiums and unequal coverages. Gardner has shown mixed responses on the topic of repealing the Affordable Care act as he has previously voted to prevent the Trump administration from repealing the ACA, yet he continues to oppose it. Gardner has not yet supported or presented legislature that would provide an alternate form of healthcare; however, he did present a bill regarding protections against pre-existing conditions. The bill, named the “Pre-Existing Conditions Protections Act” simply rooted out the key coverage protections against citizens that have pre-existing conditions that the ACA provided, but the bill’s vague nature and lack of detail has many experts claiming that the bill was simply a way to keep his standing in the senate race. 
  </p>

  <h2> Economy / Tax cuts</h2>
  <p class="styleSenator">
    Through both candidates, Hickenlooper and Gardner, claim that they have helped champion the economic strength Colorado has recently seen, however, economists have stated that neither Gardner nor Hickenlooper had the impact they claim to have had. On the issue of tax cuts, both candidates have opposing views. Hickenlooper believes that the tax cuts that have been given to big corporations needs to be put to an end. He has showed support of a system that would put investments back into the community through investing in skilled trade programs and communities of color. Additionally, Hickenlooper has claimed that he will expand programs that call for easier ways to expand small businesses. In contrast, Gardner has long claimed that his support of large tax cuts for big corporations is what is going to expand the economy. Gardner has voiced support for looser regulations that will motivate companies to move their businesses to states like Colorado. As both candidates have similar viewpoints to providing stimulus funds during the COVID-19 Pandemic, they are set apart on their views regarding tax cuts.  
  </p>

  <h2> Policing Reforms</h2>
  <p class="styleSenator">
    Hickenlooper has supported the idea that there are fundamental steps that congress can take to address police brutality and systemic racism. Some of the steps that he outlines are using body cameras, swift disciplinary actions and transparency in policing data. On the other hand, Gardner, though he too supports reforms to policing, does not support the drastic changes that Hickenlooper suggests. Gardner rejected sweeping police reforms suggested by the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act claiming that the reforms the republican party presented were much more favorable than what the democratic backed bill suggested. Furthermore, Gardner has also received donations from Soros, a private prison company family. (there is no known record of Hickenlooper’s stance on private prisons)
