                    We are DSST GVR Robotics club. We are participate in The "<a  class="webLink"href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" target="_blank">FIRST Robotics competition</a>". In Competition Group of students are required to design and build a industrial-size robot and compete against other groups of students participating in the competition. However, our school is a Title 1 school which means most of the students are from low to mid income rate families as such the necessary expenses for the competition and some of the parts required to build the robot is unaffordable for the student base.It is for this reason that we are reaching out to you in hope of receiving funds to participate in the competition.

                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Regarding DSST:GVR, we would like to give you some background information on the school so that you can better grasp the enormity of the impact that participating in a competition like this would have on the students.

                </br>
                    As we have stated previously DSST:GVR is a Title 1 school, As a result of this many of the families have no experience attending college.That being said, DSST prides itself on the fact that for every year since its inception we have maintained a 100% college acceptance rate across all campuses. The focus of DSST, however, is on college success and graduation.The participation in a competition like the FIRST will allow the students to gain both technical skills and knowledge in engineering, as well as opening the doors to some prestigious academic institutions that would be able to support them financially.
